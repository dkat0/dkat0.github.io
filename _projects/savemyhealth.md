HackCMU 2024 had a cyberpunk theme, and our team decided to focus on the healthcare category. With a shared interest in leveraging technology for longevity, we created **SaveMyHealth**.

[SaveMyHealth](https://savemyhealth.aeylabs.com/) is an AI-driven web application designed to empower users on their journey to better health. Whether users look to make small changes or address dangerously unhealthy lifestyles, SaveMyHealth provides personalized advice based off their unique profiles that is supported by cutting-edge scientific research in longevity and wellness.

### Features

- **Hard Hitting Numbers: Life Expectancy / Medical Cost Prediction**:  
  Through analyzing key factors such as BMI, exercise, sleep, and alcohol consumption, SaveMyHealth estimates life expectancy using a specialized model and predicts lifetime medical costs using Random Forest Regression. These metrics can often be hard hitting and offer a compelling perspective to motivate change.

- **Personalized Health Recommendations**:  
  The app leverages a language model with in-context learning and delivers actionable health tips based on individual user profiles. These recommendations lie in the pivotal areas ofdiet, exercise, habits, and stress management, and are supported by [NOVOS](https://novoslabs.com/live-longer-slow-aging-life-extension-blog/) research.

Ultimately, SaveMyHealth offers a powerful algorithmic and data-driven approach to health, enabling users to make informed decisions and take meaningful steps toward a healthier, longer life.
