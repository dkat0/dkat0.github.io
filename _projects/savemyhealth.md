HackCMU 2024 had a cyberpunk theme, and our team decided to focus on the healthcare category. With a shared interest in leveraging technology for longevity, we created **SaveMyHealth**.

SaveMyHealth is an AI-driven web application designed to empower users on their journey to better health. Whether users look to make small changes or address dangerously unhealthy lifestyles, SaveMyHealth provides personalized advice based off their unique profiles that is supported by cutting-edge scientific research in longevity and wellness.

### Features

- **Hard Hitting Numbers: Life Expectancy / Medical Cost Prediction**:  
  Through analyzing key factors such as BMI, exercise, sleep, and alcohol consumption, SaveMyHealth estimates life expectancy using a specialized model and predicts lifetime medical costs using Random Forest Regression that we trained. These metrics can often be hard hitting and offer a compelling perspective to motivate change.

- **Personalized Health Recommendations**:  
  We implemented a language model with in-context learning to deliver actionable health tips based on individual user profiles. These recommendations lie in the pivotal areas ofdiet, exercise, habits, and stress management, and are supported by [NOVOS](https://novoslabs.com/live-longer-slow-aging-life-extension-blog/) research.

While SaveMyHealth is still a proof of concept, it showcases the exciting potential of algorithmic and data-driven approaches to how we approach longevity and wellness. This project inspires us to continue exploring innovative tech for a healthier future.
