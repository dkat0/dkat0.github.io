I'm building <a href='https://absurd.com/'>Absurd</a> (YC F25) — the orchestration layer for AI video ads.

Previously, I worked on agents for VLSI chip design at <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/">NVIDIA</a>. I also studied at CMU's School of Computer Science and did ML research in <a href="https://leililab.github.io/">Li Lab</a>.
