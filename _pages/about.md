I'm building <a href='https://tryabsurd.com/'>Absurd</a> (YC F25) â€” the orchestration layer for AI video ads.

I left CMU's School of Computer Science to focus on Absurd full-time. Previously, I worked on agents for VLSI chip design at <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/">NVIDIA</a>, and did ML research at CMU's <a href="https://leililab.github.io/">Li Lab</a>.

In my free time, I enjoy lifting, piano, trying new food, and spending time with my four cats. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect!
