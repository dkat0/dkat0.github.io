I'm currently studying `Artificial Intelligence` in the [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I am passionate about exploring the frontiers of machine learning and large language models, as well as building innovative software to tackle meaningful problems.

Most recently, I worked as an ML Research Intern at CMU's [Li Lab](https://leililab.github.io/) in the [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/). During my internship, I focused on improving LLMs in code generation, spelling, and tricky string manipulation tasks (including the classic "how many r's are in strawberry"). My work involved fine-tuning advanced models, pioneering a novel non-canonical tokenization technique, and benchmarking these improvements on a custom 10,000-sample datasetâ€”leading to notable gains on state-of-the-art models.

This summer, I'll be heading to [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/) in Santa Clara, CA, for an internship centered on deep learning engineering and harnessing LLMs to enhance VLSI chip design workflows. I'm excited to see how far we can push these methods on a larger scale.

In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball, weightlifting, experimenting on the piano, checking out new restaurants, and spending time with my five cats, two brothers, and family. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect!
